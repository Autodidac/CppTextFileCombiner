# CppTextFileCombiner


C++ Text Based File Compiler/Combiner


This will take any text based set of files from a specified folder and combine them into a single file which is particularly useful in the case of uploading it to LLM AI to assist with coding.

I think currently it only supports .h and .cpp to avoid conflicts with other file types.
Future additions might include filter sets to handle such issues properly.
